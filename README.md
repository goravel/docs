## About Goravel

Goravel is a web application framework with complete functions and good scalability. As a starting scaffolding to help Gophper quickly build their own applications.

The framework style is consistent with [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel), let PHPer don't need to learn a new framework, but also happy to play around Golang! Tribute Laravel!
