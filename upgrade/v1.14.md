## Feature Introduction

### Localization

Version: v1.14.0

[View Documentation](../digging-deeper/localization.md)

### Gin and Fiber Drivers Support Setting Body Limit

Version: v1.14.0

HTTP drivers support setting body_limit to limit the body size, see: [goravel/gin](https://github.com/goravel/gin/blob/c9d7706a6a04c05c8c33af5c97877a1ad2ea6362/README.md?plain=1#L54) and [goravel/fiber](https://github.com/goravel/fiber/blob/aa63ab657cd2b371fcda4df0090a41226f6c0704/README.md?plain=1#L56).

### Validation Will Not Bind Data If Validation Fails

Version: v1.14.0

Previously, when calling `errors, err := ctx.Request().ValidateRequest(&userRequest)`, even if an error was returned, the `userRequest` still bound the value. After the upgrade, it will no longer bind.
