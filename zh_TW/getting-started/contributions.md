# Contribution Guide

[[toc]]

Goravel welcomes rich and diverse contributions from different talents, such as coding, translations, articles,
tutorials, etc. After completing two features(5 `Good First Issue` == 1 `Feature`), you will be recognized as a core
contributor. By completing one feature every three months, you can maintain this status.

Let's make Goravel more efficient together!

## Reward

- Core developers will be eligible for benefits when Goravel benefits in the future.
- After completing a `Feature`, you will receive an official Goravel T-Shirt, with a maximum of 1 per major version
  release cycle. (PS: Because of the difference of country, you may need to help us to find a suitable supplier.)
