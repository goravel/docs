# Relationships

[[toc]]

## Introduction

Database tables are often related to one another. For example, a blog post may have many comments or an order could be related to the user who placed it. Orm makes managing and working with these relationships easy, and supports a variety of common relationships:

- [One To One](#One-To-One)
- [One To Many](#One-To-Many)
- [Many To Many](#Many-To-Many)
- [Polymorphic](#Polymorphic)

## Defining Relationships

### One To One

A one-to-one relationship is a very basic type of database relationship. For example, a `User` model might be associated with one `Phone` model.

```go
type User struct {
  orm.Model
  Name  string
  Phone   *Phone
}

type Phone struct {
  orm.Model
  UserID   uint
  Name   string
}
```

Orm determines the foreign key of the relationship based on the parent model name. In this case, the `Phone` model is automatically assumed to have a `UserID` foreign key. If you want to override this convention, you can add `foreignKey` Tag to the `Phone` field in `User` model(Other relationships are similar):

```go
type User struct {
  orm.Model
  Name  string
  Phone   *Phone `gorm:"foreignKey:UserName"`
}

type Phone struct {
  orm.Model
  UserName string
  Name   string
}
```

Additionally, Orm assumes that the foreign key should have a value matching the primary key column of the parent. In other words, Orm will look for the value of the user's `id` column in the `UserId` column of the `Phone` record. If you would like the relationship to use a primary key value other than `id`, you can add `references` Tag to the `Phone` field in `User` model. pass a third argument to the hasOne method(Other relationships are similar):

```go
type User struct {
  orm.Model
  Name  string
  Phone   *Phone `gorm:"foreignKey:UserName;references:name"`
}

type Phone struct {
  orm.Model
  UserName string
  Name   string
}
```

#### Defining The Inverse Of The Relationship

So, we can access the `Phone` model from our `User` model. Next, let's define a relationship on the `Phone` model that will let us access the user that owns the phone. We can define a `User` field in `Phone` model:

```go
type User struct {
  orm.Model
  Name  string
}

type Phone struct {
  orm.Model
  UserID   uint
  Name   string
  User   *User
}
```

### One To Many

A one-to-many relationship is used to define relationships where a single model is the parent to one or more child models. For example, a blog post may have an infinite number of comments. Like all other Orm relationships, one-to-many relationships are defined by defining a field on your Orm model:

```go
type Post struct {
  orm.Model
  Name   string
  Comments []*Comment
}

type Comment struct {
  orm.Model
  PostID   uint
  Name   string
}
```

Remember, Orm will automatically determine the proper foreign key column for the `Comment` model. By convention, Orm will take the "hump case" name of the parent model and suffix it with `ID`. So, in this example, Orm will assume the foreign key column on the `Comment` model is `PostID`.

### One To Many (Inverse) / Belongs To

Now that we can access all of a post's comments, let's define a relationship to allow a comment to access its parent post. To define the inverse of a `One To Many` relationship, define a relationship method on the child model which calls the belongsTo method:

```go
type Post struct {
  orm.Model
  Name   string
  Comments []*Comment
}

type Comment struct {
  orm.Model
  PostID   uint
  Name   string
  Post   *Post
}
```

## Many To Many Relationships

Many-to-many relations are slightly more complicated than `One To One` and `One To Many` relationships. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a user that has many roles and those roles are also shared by other users in the application. For example, a user may be assigned the role of "Author" and "Editor"; however, those roles may also be assigned to other users as well. So, a user has many roles and a role has many users.

### Table Structure

To define this relationship, three database tables are needed: `users`, `roles`, and `role_user`. The `role_user` table naming can be customized and it contains `user_id` and `role_id` columns. This table is used as an intermediate table linking the users and roles.

Remember, since a role can belong to many users, we cannot simply place a `user_id` column on the `roles` table. This would mean that a role could only belong to a single user. In order to provide support for roles being assigned to multiple users, the `role_user` table is needed. We can summarize the relationship's table structure like so:

```
users
  id - integer
  name - string

roles
  id - integer
  name - string

role_user
  user_id - integer
  role_id - integer
```

### Model Structure

We can define a `Roles` field on `User` model:

```go
type User struct {
  orm.Model
  Name  string
  Roles   []*Role `gorm:"many2many:role_user"`
}

type Role struct {
  orm.Model
  Name   string
}
```

### Defining The Inverse Of The Relationship

To define the inverse of the relationship, just define a `Users` field in `Role` model and append a Tag.

```go
type User struct {
  orm.Model
  Name  string
  Roles   []*Role `gorm:"many2many:role_user"`
}

type Role struct {
  orm.Model
  Name   string
  Users  []*User `gorm:"many2many:role_user"`
}
```

### Custom intermediate table

In general, the intermediate table foreign key are named by the "snake case" of parent model name, you can override them by `joinForeignKey`, `joinReferences`:

```go
type User struct {
  orm.Model
  Name  string
  Roles   []*Role `gorm:"many2many:role_user;joinForeignKey:UserName;joinReferences:RoleName"`
}

type Role struct {
  orm.Model
  Name   string
}
```

Table structure:

```
users
  id - integer
  name - string

roles
  id - integer
  name - string

role_user
  user_name - integer
  role_name - integer
```

## Polymorphic

A polymorphic relationship allows the child model to belong to more than one type of model using a single association. For example, imagine you are building an application that allows users to share blog posts and videos. In such an application, a `Comment` model might belong to both the `Post` and `Video` models.

### Table structure

A polymorphic relation is similar to a normal relation; however, the child model can belong to more than one type of model using a single association. For example, a blog `Post` and a `User` may share a polymorphic relation to an `Image` model. Using a polymorphic relation allows you to have a single table of unique images that may be associated with posts and users. First, let's examine the table structure:

```
posts
  id - integer
  name - string

videos
  id - integer
  name - string

images
  id - integer
  url - string
  imageable_id - integer
  imageable_type - string

comments
  id - integer
  body - text
  commentable_id - integer
  commentable_type - string
```

Note the `imageable_id` and `imageable_type` columns on the `images` table. The `imageable_id` column will contain the ID value of the post or user, while the `imageable_type` column will contain the class name of the parent model. The `imageable_type` column is used by Orm to determine which "type" of parent model to return when accessing the `imageable` relation. The `comments` table is similar.

### Model Structure

Next, let's examine the model definitions needed to build this relationship:

```go
type Post struct {
  orm.Model
  Name     string
  Image    *Image `gorm:"polymorphic:Imageable"`
  Comments []*Comment `gorm:"polymorphic:Commentable"`
}

type Video struct {
  orm.Model
  Name     string
  Image    *Image `gorm:"polymorphic:Imageable"`
  Comments []*Comment `gorm:"polymorphic:Commentable"`
}

type Image struct {
  orm.Model
  Name          string
  ImageableID   uint
  ImageableType string
}

type Comment struct {
  orm.Model
  Name            string
  CommentableID   uint
  CommentableType string
}
```

You can change the polymorphic value by `polymorphicValue` Tag, such as:

```go
type Post struct {
  orm.Model
  Name  string
  Image   *Image `gorm:"polymorphic:Imageable;polymorphicValue:master"`
}
```

## Querying Associations

For example, imagine a blog application in which a `User` model has many associated `Post` models:

```go
type User struct {
  orm.Model
  Name   string
  Posts  []*Post
}

type Post struct {
  orm.Model
  UserID   uint
  Name     string
}
```

### Create or Update Associations

You can use the `Select`, `Omit` methods to to control the create and update of associations. These two method cannot be used at the same time and the associated control functions are only applicable to `Create`, `Update`, `Save`:

```go
user := User{Name: "user", Post: &Post{Name: "post"}}

// Create all child associations while creating User
facades.Orm().Query().Select(orm.Associations).Create(&user)

// Only create Post while creating User. Note: If you don't use `orm.Associations`, but customize specific child associations separately, all fields in the parent model should also be listed at this time.
facades.Orm().Query().Select("Name", "Post").Create(&user)

// When creating a User, ignore the Post, but create all other child associations
facades.Orm().Query().Omit("Post").Create(&user)

// When creating User, ignore Name field, but create all child associations
facades.Orm().Query().Omit("Name").Create(&user)

// When creating User, ignore Name field and all child associations
facades.Orm().Query().Omit("Name", orm.Associations).Create(&user)
```

### Find Associations

```go
// Find all matching related records
var posts []models.Post
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Association("Posts").Find(&posts)

// Find associations with conditions
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Where("name = ?", "goravel").Order("id desc").Association("Posts").Find(&posts)
```

### Append Associations

Append new associations for `Many To Many`, `One To Many`, replace current association for `One To One`, `One To One(revers)`:

```go
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Association("Posts").Append([]*Post{Post1, Post2})

facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Association("Posts").Append(&Post{Name: "goravel"})
```

### Replace Associations

Replace current associations with new ones:

```go
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Association("Posts").Replace([]*Post{Post1, Post2})

facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Association("Posts").Replace(Post{Name: "goravel"}, Post2)
```

### Delete Associations

Remove the relationship between source & arguments if exists, only delete the reference, won’t delete those objects from DB, the foreign key must be NULL:

```go
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Association("Posts").Delete([]*Post{Post1, Post2})

facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Association("Posts").Delete(Post1, Post2)
```

### Clear Associations

Remove all reference between source & association, won’t delete those associations:

```go
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Association("Posts").Clear()
```

### Count Associations

Return the count of current associations:

```go
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Association("Posts").Count()

// Count with conditions
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&user).Where("name = ?", "goravel").Association("Posts").Count()
```

### Batch Data

```go
// Find all roles for all users
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&users).Association("Posts").Find(&posts)

// Delete User A from all user's Posts
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&users).Association("Posts").Delete(&userA)

// Get distinct count of all users' Posts
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&users).Association("Posts").Count()

// For `Append`, `Replace` with batch data, the length of the arguments needs to be equal to the data's length or else it will return an error
var users = []User{user1, user2, user3}

// We have 3 users, Append userA to user1's team, append userB to user2's team, append userA, userB and userC to user3's team
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&users).Association("Team").Append(&userA, &userB, &[]User{userA, userB, userC})

// Reset user1's team to userA，reset user2's team to userB, reset user3's team to userA, userB and userC
facades.Orm().Query().Model(&users).Association("Team").Replace(&userA, &userB, &[]User{userA, userB, userC})
```

## Eager Loading

Eager loading conveniences for querying multiple models, and alleviates the "N + 1" query problem. To illustrate the N + 1 query problem, consider a `Book` model that "belongs to" to an `Author` model:

```go
type Author struct {
  orm.Model
  Name  string
}

type Book struct {
  orm.Model
  AuthorID   uint
  Name       string
  Author     *Author
}
```

Now, let's retrieve all books and their authors:

```go
var books models.Book
facades.Orm().Query().Find(&books)

for _, book := range books {
  var author models.Author
  facades.Orm().Query().Find(&author, book.AuthorID)
}
```

This loop will execute one query to retrieve all of the books within the database table, then another query for each book in order to retrieve the book's author. So, if we have 25 books, the code above would run 26 queries: one for the original book, and 25 additional queries to retrieve the author of each book.

Thankfully, we can use eager loading to reduce this operation to just two queries. When building a query, you may specify which relationships should be eager loaded using the `With` method:

```go
var books models.Book
facades.Orm().Query().With("Author").Find(&books)

for _, book := range books {
  fmt.Println(book.Author)
}
```

For this operation, only two queries will be executed - one query to retrieve all of the books and one query to retrieve all of the authors for all of the books:

```sql
select * from books

select * from authors where id in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...)
```

### Eager Loading Multiple Relationships

Sometimes you may need to eager load several different relationships. To do so, just call the `With` method multiple times:

```go
var book models.Book
facades.Orm().Query().With("Author").With("Publisher").Find(&book)
```

### Nested Eager Loading

To eager load a relationship's relationships, you may use "dot" syntax. For example, let's eager load all of the book's authors and all of the author's personal contacts:

```go
var book models.Book
facades.Orm().Query().With("Author.Contacts").Find(&book)
```

### Constraining Eager Loads

Sometimes you may wish to eager load a relationship but also specify additional query conditions for the eager loading query. You can accomplish this as below:

```go
import "github.com/goravel/framework/contracts/database/orm"

var book models.Book
facades.Orm().Query().With("Author", "name = ?", "author").Find(&book)

facades.Orm().Query().With("Author", func(query orm.Query) orm.Query {
  return query.Where("name = ?", "author")
}).Find(&book)
```

In this example, Orm will only eager load posts where the post's `name` column equal the word `author`. 

### Lazy Eager Loading

Sometimes you may need to eager load a relationship after the parent model has already been retrieved. For example, this may be useful if you need to dynamically decide whether to load related models:

```go
var books models.Book
facades.Orm().Query().Find(&books)

for _, book := range books {
  if someCondition {
    err := facades.Orm().Query().Load(&book, "Author")
  }
}
```

If you need to set additional query constraints on the eager loading query, you can use the code as below:

```go
import "github.com/goravel/framework/contracts/database/orm"

var book models.Book
facades.Orm().Query().Load(&book, "Author", "name = ?", "author").Find(&book)

facades.Orm().Query().Load(&book, "Author", func(query orm.Query) orm.Query {
  return query.Where("name = ?", "author")
}).Find(&book)
```

To load a relationship only when it has not already been loaded, use the `LoadMissing` method:

```go
facades.Orm().Query().LoadMissing(&book, "Author")
```
